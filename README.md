# Skin-Lesion-Segmentation
# Background
Automatic skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images is an essential step in computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. However, this task is challenging due to significant
variations of lesion appearances across different patients.Clinical treatment of skin lesion is primarily dependent on timely detection and delimitation
of lesion boundaries for accurate cancerous region localization.
# Introduction
We present a fully automated architecture for accurately detecting border and segmenting the skin lesion by coupling a deep learning model with the Berkeley wavelet transform map derived from the specific kernel filters. 2.	Our proposed method effectively combines the Berkeley wavelet transform feature maps into a deep learning U-Net model trained in an end-to-end manner, which results in the reduction of the number of trainable parameters.
